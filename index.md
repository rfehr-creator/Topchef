Vision Statement
 
Top Chef is a comprehensive recipe management app that allows users to spend less time searching and more time cooking. It contains an appealing user-interface that is consistent with modern cooking and recipe websites, including the display of recipe names, ingredients, quantities, instructions, food images, and more.

The application is designed for those who love food and cooks of all skill levels, and includes a simple user-interface to attract users of all technological proficiencies. Whether youâ€™re a beginner cook or a seasoned chef, Top Chef makes it easy to view, add, delete, organize, edit, and search existing recipes within their application profile. Built-in quality of life tools aim to attract users accustomed to varying measurement types, as well as useful tools for meal planners and grocery shoppers.

Top Chef is valuable because it gives users the ability to create and save their own recipes with all the necessary details, including recipe names, ingredient list, measurement types, and step-by-step instructions, leading to the centralization of recipe storage. Rather than storing recipes across several files, webpage bookmarks, or recipe books, our system will allow for the easy integration of any recipe into one location. Furthermore, through the ability to add your own recipes, the app allows users to create their own virtual and personalized recipe book, saving them shelf space at home. 

Built-in conversion tools will also aid those who find an interesting recipe but are deterred by uncommon or undesirable units. For example, if a recipe lists ingredient quantities in cups, we will offer the ability to switch to metric measurements in litres or millilitres. Meal planners and grocery shoppers may also use the functionality of adjusting portion sizes or exporting a grocery list to greatly enhance the efficiency of grocery shopping. Further, our system will benefit cooks who are unsure of what to make. Given some ingredient selections, our system will allow the user to view all related recipes. For example, if the user would like to create a pasta dish, they will be able to view all pasta-related recipes within the application through our tagging system.

The project will be considered successful if each type of user prefers this system over existing cooking apps and books, as determined by survey, and the time spent looking for recipes are reduced by at least 25% from the current level.
