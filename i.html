            <p>Top Chef is a comprehensive recipe management app that allows users to spend less time searching and more
                time cooking.
                It contains an appealing user-interface that is consistent with modern cooking and recipe websites,
                including the
                display of recipe names, ingredients, quantities, instructions, food images, and more.</p>

            <p>The application is designed for those who love food and cooks of all skill levels, and includes a simple
                user-interface
                to attract users of all technological proficiencies. Whether youâ€™re a beginner cook or a seasoned chef,
                Top
                Chef makes
                it easy to view, add, delete, organize, edit, and search existing recipes within their application
                profile.
                Built-in
                quality of life tools aim to attract users accustomed to varying measurement types, as well as useful
                tools
                for meal
                planners and grocery shoppers.</p>

            <p>Top Chef is valuable because it gives users the ability to create and save their own recipes with all the
                necessary
                details, including recipe names, ingredient list, measurement types, and step-by-step instructions,
                leading
                to the
                centralization of recipe storage. Rather than storing recipes across several files, webpage bookmarks,
                or
                recipe books,
                our system will allow for the easy integration of any recipe into one location. Furthermore, through the
                ability to add
                your own recipes, the app allows users to create their own virtual and personalized recipe book, saving
                them
                shelf space
                at home.</p>

            <p>Built-in conversion tools will also aid those who find an interesting recipe but are deterred by uncommon
                or
                undesirable
                units. For example, if a recipe lists ingredient quantities in cups, we will offer the ability to switch
                to
                metric
                measurements in litres or millilitres. Meal planners and grocery shoppers may also use the functionality
                of
                adjusting
                portion sizes or exporting a grocery list to greatly enhance the efficiency of grocery shopping.
                Further,
                our system
                will benefit cooks who are unsure of what to make. Given some ingredient selections, our system will
                allow
                the user to
                view all related recipes. For example, if the user would like to create a pasta dish, they will be able
                to
                view all
                pasta-related recipes within the application through our tagging system.</p>

            <p>The project will be considered successful if each type of user prefers this system over existing cooking
                apps and books,
                as determined by survey, and the time spent looking for recipes are reduced by at least 25% from the
                current
                level.</p>
